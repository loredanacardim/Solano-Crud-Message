# Solana PDA Demo (Anchor Program)

This repository contains my first Solana program using **Anchor framework** and **Program Derived Addresses (PDAs)**, built as part of my learning journey.

## ðŸ“Œ What this program does
- Derives PDAs for user-specific accounts (`message` and `vault`)
- Creates, updates, and deletes on-chain accounts
- Transfers SOL using CPI calls to the System Program
- Dynamically reallocates account space when updating data
