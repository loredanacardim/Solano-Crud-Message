# Solana PDA Demo (Anchor Program)

This repository contains my first Solana program using the Anchor framework and Program Derived Addresses (PDAs), developed as part of my learning journey.

---

## 📌 What this program does

- Derives PDAs for user-specific accounts (message and vault)  
- Creates, updates, and deletes on-chain accounts  
- Transfers SOL using CPI calls to the System Program  
- Dynamically reallocates account space when updating data

## 📚 About

This project was built following the official Solana tutorial for Anchor and PDAs. The goal is to understand key concepts like PDA derivation, account management, and Solana's cross-program invocations.

## 👩‍💻 Next steps

I will continue exploring Solana development by building more complex programs involving token management and cross-program invocations.
